# ImFEATbox

ImFEATbox (Image Feature Extraction and Analyzation Toolbox) is a toolbox for extracting and analyzing features for image processing applications. The provided feature extraction algorithms have been used in context of automated MR image quality assessment, but should be applicable to a variety of image processing tasks not limited to medical imaging.

This work is part of a research project of the Department of Interventional and Diagnostic Radiology, University Hospital of Tuebingen, Germany and the Institute of Signal Processing and System Theory, University of Stuttgart, Germany.

This toolbox is regularly being extended, for an up-to-date list of all implemented feature extraction algorithms please view features.pdf

We are happy if you can benefit from our work. You are free to use and modify the codes provided in ImFEATbox for your own research, but please cite the following publication:
